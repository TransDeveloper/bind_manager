# Bind Manager
### What is Bind Manager?
Bind Manager is a tool in progress to aid you with BIND9 configuration. Right now, it only manages blocklists, but it will be expanded to manage other configurations as well.

I would not recommend using this right now, especially in a production environment. It is still in development and may have bugs. If you do decide to use it, please make sure to back up your configuration files.
